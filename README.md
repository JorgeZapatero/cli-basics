# cli-basics

At Lewis & Clark, using command line interfaces (CLIs) will be an important part of your CS education, and your computational life outside of LC. Unfortunately, LC doesn't spend a whole lot of time teaching how to use a command-line interface.

This repository will (hopefully) help orient you in your quest to better understand command-line interfaces.
